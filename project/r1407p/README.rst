Matrix matrix1 = Matrix::load_data(std::vector<std::vector<int>>{{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}});
vector<vector<int>> data = matrix1.get_data();

auto multiply = matrix1.multiply(matrix2);
auto add = matrix1.add(matrix2);
auto subtract = matrix1.subtract(matrix2);

auto determinant = matrix1.determinant();
